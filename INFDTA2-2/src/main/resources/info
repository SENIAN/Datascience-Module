[Start] Create an initial population of 𝑛 individuals
[Fitness] Evaluate the fitness 𝑓(𝑥) of each individual 𝑥 in the population
[New population] Create a new population by repeating the following steps (until the
new population is complete)
[Selection] Select two parent from the population according to their fitness (the better fitness, the
bigger chance to be selected for reproduction)
[Crossover] With a crossover probability, cross over the parents to form new offspring (children); if
no crossover was performed, offspring is an exact copy of parents
[Mutation] With a mutation probability, mutate information encoded by new offspring
[Accepting] Place new offspring in the new population
[Test] Termination condition satisfied?
Yes  Return the best solution in the new population
No  Go to step [Fitness] and repeat the loop using the new population for a further run of the
algorithm
